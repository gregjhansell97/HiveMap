# Hive-Map

Modular Pub-Sub Framework

## Introduction
The [pub-sub pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) is generic, but it is used to tackle specific problems. These problems have specific requirements and contexts. There is no one-size-fits-all implementation. For example, pub-sub systems that use [mobile-adhoc-networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_ad_hoc_network) will have a different implementations than pub-sub systems that use the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). Past approaches tackle a subset of pub-sub problems and put them into a framework [TODO ADD CITATIONS]. Hive-Map takes a different approach. The Hive-Map framework abstracts the pub-sub pattern enough to encopass the full problem set. This abstraction allows Hive-Map components to be reimplemented, tested, benchmarked and shared easily. The framework user picks the modules that best suits their problem.        

## Background

### pub-sub paradigm

The power of the publisher-subscriber model comes from decoupling the producers of information from the consumers. In any pub-sub architecture, there are four main components: events, subscriptions, publishers and subscribers.

|Component| Description|
|------------|----------|
|Event       | piece of information that happened in the system|
|Subscription| expressed interest in a subset of possible events|
|Publisher   | publishes events|
|Subscriber  | notified of published events that match its subscription|

*The figure above shows the typical interaction in any pub-sub system. The symbol e is an event. The symbol &#963; is a subscription. The node *P* is a publisher. The node *S* is a subscriber [1].*

Imagine a scenario about weather. In this system, events are descriptions of weather in certain locations: "It's sunny in LA" or "It's rainy in Boston". Subscriptions would express interest in these locations: "I'm interested in LA's weather". A subscriber could use a subscription to be notified about certain weather events. 

The important detail, in the weather example, is that subscribers are completely decoupled from publishers. A subscriber wants to be notified about events that match its subscription; it is indifferent to the source of the event. A publisher publishes events; it is indifferent to the subscribers that receive the event. A decoupled system allows publishers and subscribers to scale independently: there can be a million subscribers, and the behavior of a publisher does not change.
