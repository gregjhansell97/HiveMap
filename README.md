# Hive-Map

Communication Agnostic Distributed Pub-Sub Network

## Description

Locations have attributes. For example: various points on a car engine have 
different temperatures; a room in the library is either occupied or unoccupied; 
a garbage can on the side of the road has various trash levels. These
attributes change over time: a car warming up on a cold day, a person entering
an empty study room, garbage being emptied on a monday morning. These changes
often go unnoticed, but they are the key to solving many problems: what part of
your engine broke? What rooms are available to study in? Did we miss the garbage
truck? The goal of Hive-Map is to provide the framework needed to tackle these
problems in a distributed setting.

**Hive-map gets messages about attribute information from one location to another.**

A **location** is an entity that represents a point in the hive-map space. Locations
are connected to one another through **channels**. Channels are the means in which
locations communicate. Locations publish messages to **destinations**. A destination 
is another location in the hive-map space. A location subscribes callbacks to desired
message types. INSERT DIAGRAM.

**Locations with matching destinations can work together to get their updated states
to that location**

The user of the framework describes the communication channels, available locations,
and types of messages. Hive-map handles routing published messages to destinations. 


## Goal

A library that performs distributed routing of states for a set of uniquely characterized nodes

## Examples

### Library Occupancy Detection

The goal of library occupancy detection is to get occupancy information from rooms
in the library to a database. Some locations are: *room 1*, *room 2* and 
*occupancy database*. The messages being published are messages that describe 
occupancy. A particular room publishes occupancy messages to the occupancy database. 
The occupancy database (as a location) subscribes to occupancy messages. The user 
describes the communication channels between locations, the available locations and 
message types. Hive-map handles routing occupancy messages from rooms to the 
occupancy database.

## Components

### Node
An entity sampling a location. A node has several attributes: location, goal location, 
communication channels and a state. Location is the place the node resides. Goal location is
the place a node wishes to send all of it's state changes to. A node sends a state change to a
location, not another node. Communication channels are used by a node to interact with other nodes.
State is the measurements of the node's space.
 
#### Assumptions
- node locations are abstract
- node's location is fixed or anonymous
- node's goal location is fixed, anonymous or doesn't exist
- nodes only communicate through channels
- nodes in the same location have dependable FIFO channels of communication
- nodes do not crash
- new nodes can be introduced into the system

### Space
Dimensions used to measure a nodes surroundings

### State
Specific values of the Space that the Node has measured

### Channels
Communication links between nodes
