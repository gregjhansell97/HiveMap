# Hive-Map

Modular Pub-Sub System

## Description

### Background

The power of the publisher-subscriber model comes from decoupling the producers of information from the consumers. There are four main pub-sub components: events, subscriptions, publishers and subscribers.

|Component| Description|
|------------|----------|
|Event       | piece of information that happened in the system|
|Subscription| expresses interest in a subset of possible events|
|Publisher   | publish events|
|Subscriber  | notified of published events that match its subscription|
