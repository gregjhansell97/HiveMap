HiveMap is a web dashboard combining dynamic IoT sensor data with static room information. Students can filter rooms based on their accessibility requirements and see them on floor plan, and the rooms update with live sensor data. Administrators can design floor plans using our custom graphical generator tool.

Try out the graphical floor map editor! JSON results are sent to the javascript log.
