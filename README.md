# Hive-Map

Communication Agnostic Distributed Pub-Sub Network

## Description

**Hive-map provides a framework to facilitate message publishing between user 
defined locations.**

A **location** is an entity that represents a point on a symbolic map. Locations
are connected to one another through **channels**. Channels are the means in 
which locations communicate. Locations publish messages to **destinations**. A 
destination is another location on the symbolic map. A location has subscribers 
to various message types.

In the diagram above, *L<sub>2</sub>* publishes a message to *L<sub>4</sub>*. 
Upon receiving the message, *L<sub>4</sub>* will deliver the message to the 
appropriate subscribers; an appropriate subscriber subscribes to that message 
type. Subscribers are not part of the diagram: they are language dependent 
programming constructs.

**Locations with matching destinations can work together to get their messages
to those destinations.**

The user of the framework describes the communication channels, available 
locations, and types of messages. Hive-map handles routing published messages to 
destinations. 


## Goal

A framework to perform distributed routing of subscribable messages from 
locations to destinations.

## Examples

### Library Occupancy Detection

The goal of library occupancy detection is to get occupancy information from 
rooms in the library to a database. Some locations are: *room 1*, *room 2* and 
*occupancy database*. The messages being published are messages that describe 
occupancy. A particular room publishes occupancy messages to the occupancy 
database. The occupancy database (as a location) subscribes to occupancy 
messages. The user describes the communication channels between locations, the 
available locations and message types. Hive-map handles routing occupancy 
messages from rooms to the occupancy database.

## Components

### Node
An entity sampling a location. A node has several attributes: location, goal 
location, communication channels and a state. Location is the place the node 
resides. Goal location is the place a node wishes to send all of it's state 
changes to. A node sends a state change to a location, not another node. 
Communication channels are used by a node to interact with other nodes. State is 
the measurements of the node's space.
 
#### Assumptions
- node locations are abstract
- node's location is fixed or anonymous
- node's goal location is fixed, anonymous or doesn't exist
- nodes only communicate through channels
- nodes in the same location have dependable FIFO channels of communication
- nodes do not crash
- new nodes can be introduced into the system

### Space
Dimensions used to measure a nodes surroundings

### State
Specific values of the Space that the Node has measured

### Channels
Communication links between nodes
